    <h1>Peak Oil: Key Concepts</h1>
    
    <div class="accordion">
        <div class="accordion-header">What is Peak Oil?</div>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>Peak oil refers to the hypothetical point in time when global oil production reaches its maximum rate, after which it enters a terminal decline. This concept is based on the observation that the rate of oil production for an individual oil well or oil field follows a bell-shaped curve.</p>
            <p>The theory suggests that as global oil reserves are finite, world oil production will eventually reach a peak and then decline, potentially leading to significant economic and social consequences.</p>

    <div class="accordion">
        <div class="accordion-header">Environmental Implications</div>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>The environmental implications of peak oil are complex and multifaceted:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>As conventional oil becomes scarcer, there may be increased pressure to exploit unconventional sources like tar sands or shale oil, which often have greater environmental impacts.</li>
                <li>The decline in oil production could lead to a shift towards more sustainable energy sources, potentially reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
                <li>However, it might also lead to increased use of coal, which could worsen climate change impacts.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="accordion-header">Policy Responses</div>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>Governments and organizations have proposed various policy responses to address peak oil:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Investing in renewable energy research and development</li>
                <li>Implementing energy efficiency measures</li>
                <li>Developing strategic petroleum reserves</li>
                <li>Encouraging sustainable urban planning and transportation systems</li>
                <li>Promoting conservation and reduced consumption</li>
